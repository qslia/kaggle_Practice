# Sum Assessments Feature Engineering

## Overview
This code creates a new feature called `sum_assesments` by aggregating multiple service assessment ratings from an airline passenger satisfaction dataset.

## Code Explanation

```python
train_df['sum_assesments'] = train_df['Inflight wifi service'] + train_df['Online boarding'] + train_df['Gate location'] + train_df['Baggage handling'] 
+ train_df['Checkin service'] + train_df['Seat comfort'] + train_df['Inflight service'] + train_df['Cleanliness']
```

## What This Code Does

### Purpose
Creates a composite score by summing up 8 different service rating columns from the airline passenger satisfaction dataset.

### Features Being Summed
1. **Inflight wifi service** - Rating for WiFi quality during flight
2. **Online boarding** - Rating for the online boarding process
3. **Gate location** - Rating for gate location convenience
4. **Baggage handling** - Rating for baggage handling service
5. **Checkin service** - Rating for check-in service quality
6. **Seat comfort** - Rating for seat comfort level
7. **Inflight service** - Rating for overall inflight service
8. **Cleanliness** - Rating for cleanliness of the aircraft

### How It Works
- **Operation**: Element-wise addition across multiple columns
- **Result**: A new column `sum_assesments` that contains the total score for each passenger
- **Data Type**: Numeric (sum of individual ratings)

### Why Create This Feature?
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Combines multiple correlated features into a single composite metric
2. **Overall Satisfaction Indicator**: Provides a holistic view of passenger experience across key service areas
3. **Feature Engineering**: Can improve model performance by capturing aggregate service quality
4. **Simplification**: Easier to analyze overall service performance rather than individual metrics

## Example
If a passenger rated services as follows:
- Inflight wifi service: 4
- Online boarding: 5
- Gate location: 3
- Baggage handling: 4
- Checkin service: 5
- Seat comfort: 4
- Inflight service: 5
- Cleanliness: 4

Then: `sum_assesments` = 4 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 = **34**

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Typo**: The feature is named `sum_assesments` (with one 's') instead of `sum_assessments` (correct spelling)
- This feature assumes all rating columns use the same scale (typically 0-5 or 1-5)
- Missing values (NaN) in any column will result in NaN for the sum
- This same transformation is applied to both `train_df` and `test_df` to maintain consistency

## Context in the Pipeline
This feature engineering step appears after:
- Loading the data
- Dropping unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0` and `id`)

And is followed by:
- Creating `Delay Change During Flight` feature
- Further data analysis and modeling
