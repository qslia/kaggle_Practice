The default method for pandas `.corr()` is Pearson (linear) correlation.

## Default Correlation Method

When you call:
```python
corr_mat = train_df[features].corr()
```

This is equivalent to:
```python
corr_mat = train_df[features].corr(method='pearson')
```

## Available Correlation Methods in pandas

Pandas `.corr()` supports multiple methods:

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **`'pearson'`** (default) | Linear correlation | Data with normal distribution, linear relationships |
| `'spearman'` | Rank-based correlation | Non-parametric, robust to outliers, monotonic relationships |
| `'kendall'` | Rank-based correlation | Similar to Spearman, uses tau instead of rho |
| `'phik'` | Phi_K correlation | Handles non-numeric columns |

## Your Code Context

Looking at your notebook, earlier you have:

```python
# Correlation matrix (Pearson by default)
features = ['Flight Distance', 'Departure Delay in Minutes', 'Arrival Delay in Minutes', 'Delay Change During Flight']
corr_mat = train_df[features].corr()  # Uses 'pearson' by default

# Spearman matrix (more robust for skewed delays)
spearman_mat = train_df[features].corr(method='spearman')  # Explicitly uses 'spearman'
```

So `corr_mat` uses Pearson by default, which measures linear relationships between the features.
