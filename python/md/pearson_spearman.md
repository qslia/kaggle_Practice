I can see from your selected code that you're calculating correlation coefficients between departure delay and arrival delay. Let me read the notebook to get more context and explain what these variables represent.

Based on the code I can see, let me explain what `r_pearson` and `r_spearman` represent:

## `r_pearson` and `r_spearman` Explanation

These are **correlation coefficients** that measure the relationship between two variables:
- **Departure Delay in Minutes** 
- **Arrival Delay in Minutes**

### `r_pearson` (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)
- **Range**: -1 to +1
- **Measures**: Linear relationship between the two delay variables
- **Interpretation**:
  - +1: Perfect positive linear correlation (as departure delay increases, arrival delay increases proportionally)
  - 0: No linear correlation
  - -1: Perfect negative linear correlation
- **Assumption**: Assumes the data follows a normal distribution and has a linear relationship

### `r_spearman` (Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient)
- **Range**: -1 to +1  
- **Measures**: Monotonic relationship (not necessarily linear)
- **How it works**: Converts values to ranks, then calculates correlation on the ranks
- **Advantages**: 
  - More robust to outliers
  - Doesn't assume normal distribution
  - Can detect non-linear monotonic relationships
- **Better for**: Skewed data like flight delays (which often have many small delays and few very large delays)

### Why Both Are Calculated
The code calculates both because:
1. **Pearson** shows the linear relationship strength
2. **Spearman** shows the monotonic relationship strength and is more robust for delay data
3. Comparing them helps understand if the relationship is linear or just monotonic

In the context of airline delays, you'd expect both to be positive and close to 1, since departure delays typically lead to arrival delays. The Spearman correlation might be more reliable here since delay data is often skewed (many flights with small delays, few with very large delays).
