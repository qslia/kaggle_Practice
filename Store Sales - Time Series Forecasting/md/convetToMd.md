I'll help you convert the current file to proper markdown format. Let me first read the file to see its current content.
Now I'll convert this file to proper markdown format with correct LaTeX syntax:
Let me read the file without line numbers to get the exact content:
Perfect! I've successfully converted the file to proper markdown format. Here's what I changed:

1. **Added a main heading** at the top with proper markdown syntax (`#`)
2. **Converted inline math** from parentheses `(x_k)` to proper LaTeX syntax `$x_k$`
3. **Converted display math** from square brackets `[...]` to proper LaTeX block syntax `$$...$$`
4. **Fixed heading levels** from `###` to `##` for proper hierarchy
5. **Fixed LaTeX escaping** in matrices - changed single backslashes `\` to double `\\` for proper line breaks
6. **Enhanced formatting** - made "Example:" bold for better readability

The file now uses proper markdown with correct LaTeX/MathJax syntax that will render beautifully in any markdown viewer that supports math notation!
